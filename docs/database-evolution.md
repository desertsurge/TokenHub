# Database Evolution

TokenHub evolves its database with explicit, forward-only migrations. This page explains the model, the maintenance commands, and how upgrades and rollbacks interact with the database.

This page is the repository's normative source for the database evolution lifecycle and safety contract implemented by `backend/internal/dbschema`, the maintenance CLI, managed upgrades, and CI.

## Model

- **Adoption baseline.** Every database carries a migration ledger (`schema_migrations`). Databases created by older releases are adopted on the next start: the frozen schema flow completes them, they are semantically verified against a reference snapshot, and the baseline row is recorded. Fresh databases are created from frozen baseline SQL, not from the ORM flow.
- **Expand migrations** add compatible structure and run automatically at startup. **Contract migrations** remove old structure and never run at startup; they only run through the maintenance command with verified preconditions.
- **Checksums and dirty state.** Every applied migration's checksum is verified on each start. A failed non-transactional migration leaves a dirty marker that refuses startup until it is repaired; a failed transactional migration rolls back only its own version.
- **Data backfills** live in their own ledger (`data_backfills`). Blocking backfills must finish before the instance reports ready; online backfills run in idempotent batches while the service keeps serving, coordinated cluster-wide through leases so a crashed executor's work is resumed by another instance.
- **Instance heartbeats.** Every running instance publishes its release with a TTL. Contract maintenance refuses to run while instances with fresh heartbeats are live.
- **Rollback compatibility.** Each release declares the database state range it can fully run on. Managed rollback runs a read-only preflight first: releases without a verified compatibility record are refused as `unknown`, and a database state outside the target release's range is refused as `incompatible`. The admin console marks rollback targets as database compatible, incompatible, or unknown.

Readiness (`/readyz`, `/healthz`) fails while the ledger is dirty or unverifiable or a blocking backfill is incomplete. Pending online backfills never affect readiness.

## Maintenance commands

The main binary ships a `db` subcommand:

```bash
tokenhub db status                                  # ledger, backfills, live instances
tokenhub db verify                                  # ledger checksums + semantic schema check
tokenhub db prepare                                 # startup-compatible adoption + expands, without serving
tokenhub db migrate                                 # apply pending expand migrations
tokenhub db repair --version <n>                    # clear a dirty migration (verified repair only)
tokenhub db contract --dry-run                      # preflight a contract migration
tokenhub db contract --backup-reference <ref> --maintenance
```

The database is resolved from `TOKENHUB_DATABASE_URL` (or the default SQLite path).

`contract` requires all of the following before it executes anything: every data backfill complete, no live instance heartbeats, an operator-verified backup reference, and an explicit maintenance assertion. For SQLite, create the built-in backup first; for PostgreSQL, provide the external backup reference that you verified yourself.

## Operational notes

- A startup error `checksum_mismatch (version 4)` can result from the historical metering migration checksum regression. Use a release containing the compatibility fix, then run `tokenhub db prepare` and `tokenhub db verify` before restarting normally. It recognizes both the original SQL checksum and the exact intermediate `tokenhub-schema-metering-evidence-v2` value, preserves existing ledger rows, and leaves audit correlation changes in migration 5. Other checksum mismatches still refuse startup; do not delete the database or edit its ledger to bypass verification. `db repair` is for dirty migrations and does not resolve this clean-ledger mismatch.
- `tokenhub db migrate` on a database without an adoption baseline points you at a normal server start: adoption happens there, inside the serialized schema section.
- A refused contract tells you which precondition failed; nothing was executed.
- After a rollback to a previous release, the previous release keeps working on the current database; when the newer release returns, it re-verifies the ledger and continues.
- A managed upgrade runs the target release's own binary against the database first: `db prepare` executes the serialized startup-compatible adoption and expand flow without publishing a serving heartbeat, so supported pre-ledger databases can be prepared before activation; `db verify` then verifies the resulting ledger and schema semantically. The target is activated only after both pass. If the activated release then fails its first boot, the previous release is re-activated automatically once (only when the upgrade ran no contract and the previous release's compatibility record covers the database state); a second failure stops version switching for operator recovery.
- The admin console shows the read-only database evolution section (state version, readiness, compatibility range, backfills, live instances); contract and repair operations are CLI-only by design.

## For developers

- The migration runner lives in `backend/internal/dbschema`. Frozen baseline SQL is embedded per dialect under `backend/internal/dbschema/migrations/`.
- Regenerate the SQLite baseline after model changes with `UPDATE_BASELINE=1 go test ./internal/server -run TestSQLiteBaselineSQLIsCurrent`; the PostgreSQL baseline regenerates the same way with `TEST_POSTGRES_URL` set and the `integration` build tag. Tests fail on a stale baseline.
- CI runs the PostgreSQL integration suite and a v0.4.0 N-1 two-way contract on SQLite and PostgreSQL: the old binary creates a database, the current release adopts it and reports ready, the old binary boots again and completes an API contract (auth, project, API key, provider, model and route, one gateway request, and audit writes), and the current release returns and reads selected durable records (project and model on both dialects, plus provider on SQLite). A separate SQLite leg pins the real v0.5.0 schema shape, adopts it, and proves both releases can boot; it does not run the CRUD contract or a PostgreSQL v0.5.0 leg. The committed immutable fixtures under `backend/internal/dbschema/fixtures/` cover v0.4.0 on both dialects and v0.5.0 on SQLite; CI checks each covered database with `go run ./cmd/n1check` before adoption.
- Regenerate the embedded migration manifest after registry or baseline changes with `go run ./cmd/manifestgen` from `backend/`; CI fails when the embedded copy is stale.
