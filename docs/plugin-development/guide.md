# TokenHub Plugin Architecture and Development Guide

Language: English | [简体中文](../zh-CN/plugin-development/guide.md) | [日本語](../ja/plugin-development/guide.md)

This guide describes the current TokenHub plugin direction and how to build against it. It is written for plugin authors, platform engineers, and operators.

The guide starts with the smallest working plugin and then explains the complete contract. In the same way that WordPress discovers a plugin from its main-file header, TokenHub discovers, validates, and loads a package from `plugin.yaml` at the package root. TokenHub additionally requires every plugin to declare its placement, capabilities, and least-privilege permissions.

> **Current implementation boundary:** Plugin API v2 is the current manifest contract; the v1 adapter remains available for existing packages. The runtime cannot yet enforce host-level process, network, and resource isolation, so it rejects every runtime-loaded external Provider, gateway hook, background job, and management action command before launch. The command examples in this guide define development contracts rather than currently deployable integrations. UI templates are declarative theme and layout capabilities, not an arbitrary React or JavaScript extension mechanism. Every built-in plugin has inspectable package files. A Settings route appears only when the manifest declares real editable settings; source files remain read-only previews and plugin code cannot be edited in the admin console.

TokenHub keeps the core small:

- the core owns auth, routing, billing, auditing, compatibility, and upgrade safety
- plugins own the parts that change more often
- built-in plugins and external plugins use the same contract
- UI templates, provider integrations, chain injection, background jobs, and admin UI contributions all come from explicit plugin metadata

## Managing Installed Plugins

TokenHub uses Office Add-ins as the reference for enterprise governance and Obsidian as the reference for plugin-management interaction. Plugin Management has two primary destinations: **Installed Plugins** owns search, status filters, versions, updates, and lifecycle actions; **Browse Plugins** lists available plugins and contains marketplace access, URL installation, ZIP upload, checksum verification, and permission-diff preview. The Installed view places four category filters directly beside the unified list: Provider Integrations, Request Pipeline, UI Templates, and Automation. There is no separate Extension Types table.

In the installed list, the plugin name and **Details** open the overview. **Settings** appears only when the plugin has editable settings and opens them directly. In the UI-template list, clicking a template with editable theme tokens opens Settings; other templates open Details. Changing the active default remains a separate action, so opening configuration never changes the live interface by accident. This hierarchy follows the WordPress [installation, update, and management pattern](https://www.waimaob2c.com/wordpress-plugins), without copying online code editing or automatic-update behavior that does not fit an enterprise gateway.

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/plugins` | Installed plugin registry and lifecycle actions |
| `/plugins/[pluginId]` | Plain-language purpose, usage, status, version, update, trust, and compatibility; implementation declarations stay in collapsed Developer Information |
| `/plugins/[pluginId]/files` | Package-relative file inventory and safe text preview |
| `/plugins/[pluginId]/settings` | Human-readable controls for safe theme-token adjustments, when the plugin declares editable values |

The overview does not expose raw capability values or serialized JSON. **Developer Information** is collapsed by default; when expanded, each capability, hook, UI contribution, action, and background job includes a short explanation before its technical identifiers.

The Files page intentionally differs from the WordPress Plugin File Editor. TokenHub never exposes absolute package paths and does not edit installed executable code. It skips symbolic links and blocks previews of binary, runtime-state, hidden, credential, secret, private, and oversized files. This keeps package inspection useful without turning the admin console into a remote-code-execution surface.

The authenticated inspection API is read-only:

- `GET /api/admin/plugins/{plugin_id}/detail`
- `GET /api/admin/plugins/{plugin_id}/file?path={package-relative-path}`

Built-in and external plugins both expose an inspectable package inventory with file count, total size, file kinds, and eligible manifest, README, license, source, configuration, and schema content. The conceptual reference is WordPress's [plugin management documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-plugins/); TokenHub retains its own manifest, permissions, and security model.

## 1. Plugin Families

TokenHub now organizes plugins into a few clear families.

| Family | What it owns | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider Integration | Upstream model access, auth, discovery, and quotas | Codex, Kimi, Gemini, Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible providers |
| Request Pipeline | Request-to-upstream pipeline behavior | privacy filters, routing, cache, context optimization, trace export |
| UI Template | Whole-shell look, layout, and template package | shell theme, page template, dashboard composition |
| Automation | Scheduled or operator-triggered work | quota refresh, sync, cleanup, reporting |

Admin UI contributions are a capability surface, not a top-level family. They are usually attached to Provider, Chain injection, or Background job plugins.

The current repository still uses the internal kind name `sim` in compatibility payloads. In user-facing language, read that as `UI template`.

A single plugin may span more than one family, but each family should stay focused. For example:

- a Codex subscription plugin is a Provider plugin that also contributes admin UI, chain hooks, and background jobs
- a trace exporter is usually a Chain injection plugin with a narrow `observe_only` hook
- a quota sync worker is usually a Background job plugin
- a shell replacement is usually a UI template plugin

## 2. Manifest Contract

Every plugin package is described by `plugin.yaml`.

```yaml
schema_version: 2
id: tokenhub.provider.kimi-go
name: Kimi Subscription Go Provider
version: 1.0.0
summary: Connect TokenHub to a Kimi subscription account.
description: Reference Go Provider plugin using the stdio-json-v1 transport.
category: provider_integration
tokenhub:
  plugin_api: v2
  min_core: 0.7.0
kinds:
  - provider
placement:
  - gateway_chain
entry:
  backend:
    protocol: stdio-json-v1
    command: bin/provider-kimi-go
capabilities:
  provider_types:
    - kimi_subscription
permissions:
  data:
    read:
      - provider_credentials
distribution:
  repository_url: https://github.com/astaxie/TokenHub
  homepage_url: https://github.com/astaxie/TokenHub/tree/main/plugin-devkit/examples/provider-kimi-go
  license: Apache-2.0
```

Important fields:

- `schema_version`: manifest schema version
- `tokenhub.plugin_api`: plugin API version
- `kinds`: one or more of `provider`, `admin_ui`, `sim`, `extension`
- `placement`: one or more of `presentation`, `gateway_chain`, `background`, `management_action`
- `capabilities`: the actual feature surface
- `permissions`: the least-privilege declaration surface
- `distribution`: repository URL, homepage URL, checksum, signature, and license metadata

`management_action` is a transitional surface for operator-only actions. New request-path behavior should move into `gateway_chain`, and recurring work should move into `background`.

## 3. Runtime Surfaces

TokenHub uses three core runtime surfaces, plus one transitional compatibility surface.

- `ServeProvider`
- `ServeGatewayHook`
- `ServeBackgroundJob`
- `ServeAction` for compatibility-only admin operations

### 3.1 Provider invocation

Provider plugins receive:

- operation
- provider projection
- resource projection
- provider model
- request payload
- credentials projection

This keeps provider plugins on projected data, not raw core internals.

### 3.2 Gateway hook invocation

Gateway hook plugins receive:

- request ID
- stage
- envelope
- optional stage data

This is the right surface for:

- privacy controls
- route candidate generation and ranking
- cache lookup and cache write
- context optimization
- request and response transforms
- trace export

### 3.3 Background job invocation

Background job plugins receive:

- plugin ID
- job ID
- trigger
- actor
- payload

This is the right surface for:

- quota sync
- heartbeat
- refresh
- cleanup
- reporting

### 3.4 Admin UI contributions

Admin UI contributions are not a separate runtime surface. They are declarative entries that render into panels, tabs, cards, and setting sections, and they should still route execution through Core.

## 4. How to Build a Plugin

The safest workflow is:

1. Pick the family first.
2. Define the smallest useful capability set.
3. Write the manifest.
4. Implement the runtime handler or UI contribution.
5. Add contract tests.
6. Run the package locally.
7. Publish to the marketplace.
8. Install to verify package inspection and lifecycle reporting inside TokenHub.

Before writing code, answer:

- Is this a Provider integration?
- Is this a UI template or admin UI contribution?
- Is this a chain-injection concern?
- Is this a Background job?
- Is this only a transitional admin action?

If you cannot answer that, the boundary is still too blurry.

### 4.1 Start small

Do not start with the full wish list.

- Provider plugin: start with one provider type and one resource or route contract
- Chain injection plugin: start with one hook stage
- Background job plugin: start with one job
- UI template plugin: start with one template, shell, or layout contribution

### 4.2 Implement the handler

Keep the handler small:

- parse the invocation
- perform the plugin's work
- return structured output
- avoid printing secrets

### 4.3 Add contract tests

Every plugin family should have contract tests.

Good tests check:

- manifest parsing
- capability completeness
- input/output shape
- secret redaction
- failure behavior

### 4.4 Run the local contract kit

The Plugin Devkit includes a local harness:

```bash
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/tokenhub-plugin-test provider --package "$PWD/examples/provider-kimi-go"
go run ./cmd/tokenhub-plugin-test hook --package "$PWD/examples/hook-trace-go"
go run ./cmd/tokenhub-plugin-test background --package "$PWD/examples/background-heartbeat-go"
```

Replace `--package` with your plugin directory.

### 4.5 Run your first plugin in five minutes

The fastest starting point is the tracked heartbeat background-job sample:

```text
plugin-devkit/
├── cmd/tokenhub-plugin-test/          # Local contract test tool
├── sdk/go/tokenhubplugin/             # Go protocol helpers
└── examples/background-heartbeat-go/
    ├── main.go
    └── plugin.yaml
```

Build the executable, then run the contract test:

```bash
cd plugin-devkit
mkdir -p examples/background-heartbeat-go/bin
go build -o examples/background-heartbeat-go/bin/background-heartbeat-go \
  ./examples/background-heartbeat-go
go run ./cmd/tokenhub-plugin-test background \
  --package "$PWD/examples/background-heartbeat-go"
```

The sample manifest keeps the plugin identity and its callable TokenHub contract together:

```yaml
schema_version: 2
id: tokenhub.background.heartbeat-go
name: Heartbeat Go Background Job
version: 1.0.0
summary: Run a supervised heartbeat job in the background.
description: Reference background job plugin.
category: automation
tokenhub:
  plugin_api: v2
  min_core: 0.7.0
kinds:
  - extension
placement:
  - background
entry:
  backend:
    protocol: stdio-json-v1
    command: bin/background-heartbeat-go
capabilities:
  background_jobs:
    - id: heartbeat.ping
      title: Heartbeat ping
      capability: contract.heartbeat
      subject: background-heartbeat-go
      schedule: "@startup"
      timeout_millis: 5000
      max_concurrency: 1
      retry:
        max_attempts: 2
        backoff_millis: 10
      input_schema:
        type: object
        required: [resource_id]
        properties:
          resource_id:
            type: string
          count:
            type: integer
      output_schema:
        type: object
        required: [resource_id, heartbeat, trigger, actor_id]
        properties:
          resource_id:
            type: string
          heartbeat:
            type: string
          trigger:
            type: string
          actor_id:
            type: string
          count:
            type: integer
```

`main.go` reads one JSON invocation from standard input and writes one JSON result to standard output. Logs and diagnostics must go to standard error; never mix them into standard output:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/astaxie/TokenHub/plugin-devkit/sdk/go/tokenhubplugin"
)

type payload struct {
	ResourceID string `json:"resource_id"`
	Count      int64  `json:"count"`
}

func main() {
	os.Exit(tokenhubplugin.ServeBackgroundJob(
		context.Background(), os.Stdin, os.Stdout, os.Stderr, handle,
	))
}

func handle(_ context.Context, invocation tokenhubplugin.BackgroundJobInvocation) (tokenhubplugin.BackgroundJobResult, error) {
	input, err := tokenhubplugin.DecodeBackgroundPayload[payload](invocation)
	if err != nil {
		return tokenhubplugin.BackgroundJobResult{}, err
	}
	if input.ResourceID == "" {
		return tokenhubplugin.BackgroundJobResult{}, fmt.Errorf("resource_id is required")
	}
	return tokenhubplugin.BackgroundJobResult{Data: map[string]any{
		"resource_id": input.ResourceID,
		"heartbeat":   "ok",
		"trigger":     invocation.Trigger,
		"actor_id":    invocation.Actor.ID,
		"count":       input.Count,
	}, Metadata: map[string]string{"status": "ok"}}, nil
}
```

Run the sample unchanged first. Then change the plugin ID, job ID, input/output schemas, and handler together. Identifiers in `plugin.yaml`, the handler, and contract fixture must stay synchronized.

## 5. Build Each Family

### 5.1 Provider plugins

Provider plugins connect TokenHub to a model service or subscription account.

They usually declare:

- `provider_types`
- `provider_resource_types`
- provider policies
- `provider.default_base_url`
- `provider.model_discovery`
- `provider.credentials_scope`

Common responsibilities:

- protocol translation
- model discovery
- quota or account sync
- credential refresh
- provider-specific route behavior
- provider-specific UI metadata

For subscription-style providers, keep quota refresh and account sync in background jobs when possible.

### 5.2 Chain injection plugins

Chain injection plugins shape the request path from the user token request to the upstream response.

Typical stages include:

- `decode_normalize`
- `admission`
- `privacy_pre`
- `guardrail_pre`
- `cache_lookup`
- `route_candidates`
- `route_rank`
- `provider_call`
- `guardrail_post`
- `usage_attribution`
- `cache_write`
- `settlement`
- `trace_export`

Typical policies:

- `fail_closed` for admission, privacy, guardrails, and routing
- `fail_open` for cache lookup and cache write
- `skip_route` for provider call wrappers
- `observe_only` for settlement and trace export

Good chain plugins are deterministic, narrow, and explicit about what they read and write.

### 5.3 UI template plugins

UI template plugins provide visual identity and limited declarative layout. They do not need an executable; the smallest package contains only `plugin.yaml`:

```yaml
schema_version: 2
id: example.sim.operations
name: Operations UI Template
version: 1.0.0
description: A compact operations template for TokenHub.
summary: Apply a compact operations layout to TokenHub.
category: ui_template
tokenhub:
  plugin_api: v2
  min_core: 0.7.0
kinds:
  - sim
placement:
  - presentation
capabilities:
  sim:
    theme_tokens:
      - id: operations-light
        mode: light
        default: true
        tokens:
          bg: "#f5f7fa"
          surface: "#ffffff"
          ink: "#172033"
          accent: "#1677ff"
          border: "#d9d9d9"
    shell_layouts:
      - id: operations-shell
        navigation: sidebar
        density: compact
        content_width: fluid
        default: true
    page_templates:
      - id: provider-detail
        target: provider.detail
        layout: two_column
        regions: [main, side]
    dashboard_compositions:
      - id: operations-dashboard
        layout: grid
        cards:
          - contribution_id: cost-overview
            region: main
            size: wide
            order: 100
```

Plugin API v2 currently supports four UI-template capabilities:

| Capability | Currently declarable content |
| --- | --- |
| `theme_tokens` | Allowlisted color, text, border, status, and shadow tokens; mode is `light`, `dark`, or `all` |
| `shell_layouts` | `sidebar` navigation; `compact`, `comfortable`, or `spacious` density; `fluid` or `comfortable` content width |
| `page_templates` | Target, `single_column`, `two_column`, `grid`, or `detail` layout, and region names |
| `dashboard_compositions` | `grid`, `operations`, or `compact_grid` layout plus card position, size, and order |

Important limitations:

- A plugin cannot inject arbitrary CSS, JavaScript, remote scripts, stylesheet URLs, `@import`, or `url(...)`.
- After installation, operators can select a template and adjust only the safe, allowlisted theme tokens declared by that template. Adjustments are stored in the current browser and are not server-side or team-wide settings.
- The Settings page contains only editable theme values, grouped by their visible effect. It does not expose capability declarations, placements, permissions, or raw schemas as settings.
- Theme variants appear as tabs. Each value has a human-readable label, a short explanation, an input control, and a restore-default action.
- Plugins without editable theme values do not show a Settings entry. Draft preview, revision history, and server-side one-click rollback are not implemented.

The publishable unit remains a structured theme/layout preset, not a complete page builder or arbitrary CSS editor. If a template also needs backend behavior, split that behavior into a Provider, Hook, background job, or management action and declare its permissions separately.

### 5.4 Background job plugins

Background job plugins handle recurring or operator-triggered work.

Typical features:

- quota refresh
- heartbeat
- sync
- cleanup
- reporting

Background job plugins should expose small inputs, predictable retries, and sanitized results.

### 5.5 Admin UI contributions

Admin UI contributions are the declarative panels, tabs, cards, and route sections used to surface plugin state and operator controls.

Reference a JSON schema file with a package-relative path in `plugin.yaml`:

```yaml
kinds: [admin_ui]
placement: [presentation]
entry:
  frontend:
    schema: ui/admin-ui.schema.json
```

The minimum `ui/admin-ui.schema.json` shape is:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "contributions": [
    {
      "id": "provider-setup",
      "slot": "provider.form.section",
      "title": "Connection settings",
      "provider_types": ["example_provider"],
      "schema": {
        "placement": "advanced",
        "fields": [
          {"name": "base_url", "type": "url", "target": "provider"},
          {"name": "api_key", "type": "secret", "target": "plugin_options"}
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Available slots are `nav.section`, `dashboard.card`, `provider.catalog.card`, `provider.form.section`, `provider.model.panel`, `provider.resource.form.section`, `provider.resource.panel`, `route.detail.panel`, `settings.panel`, `report.template`, `theme.tokens`, `layout.preset`, `page.template`, and `dashboard.composition`.

Schema control types include `text`, `secret`, `url`, `select`, `multi_select`, `switch`, `segmented`, `metric`, `table`, `log_viewer`, `code_viewer`, `action_button`, `oauth_button`, and `file_import`. Renderer support differs by slot, so test the contribution on its target page before publishing. A manifest passing validation alone does not mean every target renderer supports every control.

Rules:

- execution still passes through Core
- plugins must not bypass RBAC
- plugins must not directly use raw admin credentials
- plugin-managed actions should stay permission-scoped and auditable

## 6. Packaging and Distribution

TokenHub uses one package shape for built-in and external plugins.

Typical package contents:

- `plugin.yaml`
- one runtime entrypoint
- optional assets
- contract tests

Distribution metadata should include:

- repository URL
- homepage URL
- download URL
- checksum
- signature
- license
- compatibility metadata

The plugin marketplace URL is unset by default. Configure a working HTTP or HTTPS marketplace website to show its external Browse link. An online JSON index is discovery-only until its detached signature and revocation feed are verified; operators can install from an offline mirror or a direct ZIP URL and validate its checksum. TokenHub immediately reevaluates package validation and lifecycle state; this may activate supported declarative contributions, but it does not enable external command execution.

The ZIP may place `plugin.yaml` at the archive root or inside one top-level plugin directory; exactly one manifest must be discoverable. Do not include symlinks. Preserve executable permissions on the runtime entry, and keep `entry.backend.command` relative to the plugin directory.

For the heartbeat sample:

```bash
cd plugin-devkit
go build -o examples/background-heartbeat-go/bin/background-heartbeat-go \
  ./examples/background-heartbeat-go
cd examples/background-heartbeat-go
zip -r ../../../background-heartbeat-go.zip plugin.yaml bin
cd ../../..
shasum -a 256 background-heartbeat-go.zip
```

In the admin console, open **Plugin Management > Browse Plugins > Manual Install** and upload the ZIP, or provide an HTTPS `download_url` and lowercase SHA-256 checksum. TokenHub reevaluates the package after a successful install. Declarative presentation contributions may activate, while a package with an external command records `failed_startup`, stays inspectable, and publishes no runtime capabilities. Use the Devkit for executable contract tests.

## 7. Versioning and Compatibility

Treat versioning as three separate concerns:

| Version | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Core version | TokenHub product version |
| Plugin API version | Plugin protocol and envelope contract version |
| Plugin package version | The plugin package's own version |

Compatibility rules:

1. plugin API changes should be additive within a major version
2. manifest schema changes should stay forward compatible when possible
3. stage names should stay stable inside the same API major
4. envelope fields may be added, but existing semantics should not change silently
5. new sensitive permissions require re-approval
6. new placements or capabilities require Core validation
7. the `sim` compatibility alias may remain internally until the UI template rename is complete

The migration principle is simple:

- preserve old provider IDs
- preserve old routes
- preserve old resources and quotas
- preserve old admin payload aliases until the new contract is ready

## 8. Testing and Release Flow

Recommended order:

1. Local unit tests
2. Manifest parsing tests
3. Contract tests
4. Package-level tests
5. TokenHub integration tests
6. Marketplace and compatibility checks
7. Install, file inspection, and lifecycle-failure validation

What to emphasize by family:

- Provider plugin: route protocols, discovery, credentials projection, response shape, secret redaction
- Chain injection plugin: stage order, mutation limits, failure policy, retry and cancel behavior, permission enforcement
- UI template plugin: theme selection, layout selection, template rendering, dashboard composition
- Background job plugin: schedules, retry rules, concurrency, result sanitization
- Admin UI contribution: schema parsing, action binding, payload redaction, no arbitrary admin API calls

## 9. Built-In Compatibility and Remaining Migration

The package boundary now maps every built-in module, including all Provider catalog entries, to an inspectable plugin package. The remaining migration order is:

1. Keep provider adapters, quota, OAuth, and model discovery behind focused Provider integrations.
2. Keep gateway enhancements split into explicit Request Pipeline hooks.
3. Keep recurring work in Automation plugins.
4. Keep admin pages, panels, and buttons declarative.
5. Retain the v1 action surface only as a compatibility bridge.
6. Expand the marketplace for external authors.

This approach keeps upgrades safe because each step can ship independently and be validated with contract tests.

## 10. A Simple Decision Tree

```text
Does it connect TokenHub to a model or subscription account?
  -> Provider plugin

Does it affect the path from user token request to provider response?
  -> Chain injection plugin

Does it only change admin pages, panels, cards, or shell appearance?
  -> Admin UI contribution or UI template plugin

Does it run on a schedule or after startup?
  -> Background job plugin

Does it expose an operator-triggered action?
  -> Transitional management_action capability only if it cannot yet move into a hook or job
```

Then ask:

```text
What is the smallest permission set that makes this safe?
```

If you cannot answer that, shrink the plugin boundary again.

## 11. Migration Checklist

- [x] Map built-in modules to Provider Integration, Request Pipeline, UI Template, and Automation packages.
- [ ] Extract provider-specific model discovery and quota logic into provider plugins.
- [ ] Move request-path logic into explicit chain hooks.
- [ ] Keep admin UI contributions declarative and permission-scoped.
- [ ] Remove the old action-runner surface from the main plugin manager.
- [ ] Keep `sim` as an internal compatibility alias until the rename is complete.
- [ ] Publish production external plugins through a separate marketplace index.
- [ ] Add contract tests for every plugin family before release.

## 12. Final Rule of Thumb

When you build a plugin, optimize for:

1. smaller
2. safer
3. easier to upgrade
4. easier to separate from Core

If a behavior can live in a plugin, keep it there.
If it must stay in Core, let Core make the final decision and keep the implementation path stable.

A `provider_call` hook contributes route capability only when its complete scope matches the current request: project, API key, Provider, resource, route protocol, and the `provider_call` operation. Capability selection and hook execution share the same matcher, including legacy scope metadata. An unrelated hook cannot make a plugin-only route eligible; unsupported routes are excluded before invocation without penalizing the Provider resource. A built-in adapter's supported capabilities remain available independently of plugin hooks.

Capability admission covers Chat (including streaming), Embeddings, Responses (including streaming and background jobs), Anthropic, Gemini, and image generation, while retaining supported protocol bridges. A response-producing hook must declare `stream_events` for streaming calls or `provider_response` for non-streaming calls. Hooks declaring both can serve either mode; hooks declaring neither still participate alongside an eligible adapter or response hook but do not establish provider capability. Hooks that declare only the opposite output mode are skipped during both capability selection and execution.

Plugin download URLs and signature URLs require HTTPS and public IP addresses. Every redirect must keep the original scheme and authority; DNS is resolved and validated at connection time. Private, loopback, and link-local destinations are blocked independently of Provider upstream access settings.

A channel index can retain archived or future releases whose core ranges or required features do not match this server. Invalid compatibility syntax still rejects the index; release selection prefers the highest compatible approved SemVer with an artifact for this host. Only a strictly newer SemVer is advertised as an update. Marketplace-only entries support overview details and use listing categories for classification.

Streaming `provider_call` hooks return `stream_events` as an array of `{event, data}` objects and may return `usage`. The gateway applies `stream_transform`, `response_post`, and `guardrail_post` before emitting each event. A denial stops the stream before that event is written. `stream_transform` reads and writes event data and audit output; full `provider_response` and final `usage` writes are unsupported and rejected at validation. Use `provider_call` for provider usage or the usage attribution stage for completion-time corrections.

Routing list stages (`route_candidates` and `route_rank`) accept endpoint-protocol, project, API-key, and operation scopes. They reject Provider and resource scopes because there is no selected route; handlers can inspect the complete candidate list. An unavailable constrained dimension does not match. Supported job schedules are `@startup`, positive Go durations, and `*/N * * * *` intervals. Unsupported and overflowing values fail validation. The standalone DevKit manifest types are generated from the production schema and checked against production package fixtures.
